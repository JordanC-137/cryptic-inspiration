# Cryptic Inspo

The intention of this project is to provide a small but interesting method to inspire myself, using code, cryptography and the famous words of figures from history.

## How does it work

The mechanics of the code will consist of these steps:

#### Compile the list

Compile a txt file consisting of quotes from historical figures. To provide prolonged inspiration, the majority of these quotes should be **new and abstracted from myself**.

It does not do much good, if I am simply decrypting words I already know! To achieve this I will be compiling these quotes from several websites and sources en mass, then using web scrapers to pick through the formatting and append the words to the seperate text file.


#### Select and encrypt

This part is quite self-explanatory. A quote will be selected at random, and encrypted using one of the cryptography suites to be written by myself.


#### Send Encrypted message via SMTP
